> **EngJoy** is a modern, interactive English vocabulary learning web application built with a **gamified approach** to make studying more engaging, enjoyable, and effective.

Instead of memorizing vocabulary traditionally, EngJoy transforms learning into a fun experience through two interactive mini-games:

- 🎮 **Word Search** — find hidden words in a dynamic character grid using hints
